Replit AI Agent Prompt — One Capital dApp: Wallet Integration, Real-Time Prices, and Portfolio Display

I’ve already implemented the following features in the One Capital dApp:
	•	✓ Smart contracts for price oracle and cross-chain swaps
	•	✓ Server-side price feed service with CoinGecko integration
	•	✓ PortfolioValue component for real-time value visualization
	•	✓ CrossChainSwap component for bridgeless asset swaps
	•	✓ Backend API routes for price and cross-chain transactions

Now, I need help with wallet integration, real-time price data binding, and a comprehensive Current Portfolio component.

⸻

1. WALLET CONNECTION SUPPORT

A. L1X Wallet SDK Integration
	•	Integrate the L1X Wallet SDK (v2 Testnet).
	•	Allow users to:
	•	Connect and disconnect their L1X wallet.
	•	View their wallet address once connected.
	•	Use the connected wallet for contract interactions (vaults, swaps, price updates).
	•	Persist wallet state using localStorage.

B. MetaMask Integration
	•	Also enable MetaMask (EVM) wallet support.
	•	Detect if MetaMask is installed.
	•	Allow connection/disconnection and show wallet address.
	•	Ensure this works in parallel with L1X wallet—users should only have one active wallet at a time.
	•	Use appropriate network IDs (e.g., Ethereum Testnet or L1X-compatible EVM testnet).

⸻

2. REAL-TIME PRICE DATA IN CRYPTO ALLOCATION
	•	Use the backend /api/prices route to fetch live price data.
	•	Extend the PortfolioValue section with a Cryptocurrency Allocation table that updates dynamically.
	•	For each asset in the portfolio, display:
	•	Token name & symbol
	•	Current price in USD
	•	Amount held (crypto units)
	•	Value in USD
	•	% of total portfolio
	•	Ensure the frontend updates prices and recalculates values every 60 seconds.

⸻

3. CURRENT PORTFOLIO SECTION
	•	Add a new section on the dashboard titled “Current Portfolio”, ideally beside or below the Performance chart.
	•	Display a full breakdown in tabular format:
	•	Token name
	•	Symbol
	•	Price (USD)
	•	Amount held (token units)
	•	Value (USD)
	•	% allocation
	•	Add a Total Balance (USD) summary at the top or bottom.
	•	Optional: Show 24h change if supported by the price API.

⸻

4. TESTING & UI POLISH
	•	Ensure all new components are responsive and cleanly styled.
	•	Write unit tests and Playwright E2E tests for:
	•	Wallet connection/disconnection (both L1X and MetaMask)
	•	Price fetch and live updating
	•	Total portfolio value calculation and breakdown
	•	Optionally, animate price/value changes (e.g., flash green/red on price changes).

Please prioritize wallet SDK integration and price display first. Let me know when those are working or if you need backend or contract context to complete the integrations.

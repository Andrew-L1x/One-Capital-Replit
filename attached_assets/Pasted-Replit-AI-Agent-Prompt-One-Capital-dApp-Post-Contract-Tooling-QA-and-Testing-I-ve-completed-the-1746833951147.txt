Replit AI Agent Prompt â€” One Capital dApp: Post-Contract Tooling, QA, and Testing
I've completed the following phases of my Layer One X decentralized finance dApp (One Capital), and I now need help with testing and preparing it for production.

âœ… CURRENT STATE (Completed)
Iâ€™ve built and connected:

A contract deployment interface (WASM upload)

A contract testing UI to call functions on deployed L1X contracts

A new Contract Testing page in the frontend

Navigation from the dashboard to contract tools

TypeScript and dependency fixes across the stack

Contracts compile via wasm32-unknown-unknown and are deployable via UI

Users can now test smart contract methods directly from the browser

ðŸ”œ NEXT PHASES I NEED YOU TO HELP ME WITH:
ðŸ§ª PHASE 4: Simulated User Workflows (Functional Testing)
Help me test and simulate full user flows:

Wallet connection (via WalletConnect)

Portfolio creation (calls deployed contract)

Vault deposit / withdraw / rebalance interactions

Data flow from contract â†’ backend â†’ frontend (check sync)

Handle UI errors and transaction feedback (success/fail)
Tools to use:

L1X testnet faucet

Burner/test wallets

ðŸ§ª PHASE 5: QA Automation & CI Setup
Help me implement automated testing and continuous integration:

UI tests (Playwright or Cypress)

API route tests (Jest or Supertest for backend)

Smart contract unit tests (Rust-based)

GitHub Actions:

Build WASM contract

Lint + Typecheck

Run tests

ðŸš€ PHASE 6: Production Readiness
I want to prep for launch/demo:

Add user feedback logging (console, Sentry, or bug report form)

Host frontend (Vercel, Replit Deployment, or Netlify)

Secure backend API (CORS, HTTPS, keys if public)

Audit smart contracts (upgradeable? permission safety?)

Create onboarding guide or in-app tutorial for first-time users

OPTIONAL DEV ENHANCEMENTS
If possible, help me add:

A gas cost estimator in the contract testing tool

Function selector + prefill templates in contract testing UI

A contract state viewer (vault balances, asset allocations)

Multi-user simulation mode (for testing group portfolios or DAO strategies)

Please help implement the next logical step or recommend how to organize this in Replitâ€™s environment (scripts, testing files, workflows, or deployments).
